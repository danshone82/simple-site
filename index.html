                The A.L.P.S (Academy Learning Programme Scheme)
            </u></h1>
            <p>
                This is the A.L.P.S something i made for students to use to learn from, 
                each tier of this pyramid is roughly 10% knowledge gain, the more you 
                do the more you learn, its no good just doing classes and labs you NEED 
                to do more, thats why i have made these projects for you!

                see and interact with, primarily using languages like HTML, CSS, and 
                JavaScript to design and build a user-friendly interface (UI)

                A "back end developer" is a software developer who focuses on building and 
                maintaining the server-side components of a website or application, including 
                databases, application logic, and APIs, essentially handling the
